1.	Considering only the time they spent at home, at what rate did the participants consume tea over the one-month observation period? (i.e. average number of cups of tea per hour spent at home; note that the number of hours spent at home is different for each participant).
2.	How did their usual tea consumption rate during the month-long observation period (your prior) compare to their tea consumption rate during the five hours when their home was made colder (experimental data)? Provide the outputs of your chosen model and visualise both your prior and experimental data using density plots.
3.	Janet’s home floor plan is provided. Using a heatmap over the PNG image provided, visualize how often Janet consumed tea in the different rooms of her house.
4.	Using only Janet’s data and floor plan, what was the approximate average distance Janet travelled with her tea before she consumed it, assuming she always brewed her tea on her kitchen counter (marked with a red dot)? Use only the one-month observation period to answer this question; do not include the five-hour experimental manipulation.
5.	If you were to do this same analysis again on a dataset for a group of 20 American women, is there any additional information you would ask of the researchers? Are there any changes to the way the data was presented to you that you would recommend?
